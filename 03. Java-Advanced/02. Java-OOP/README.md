# <p align="center"> Java OOP <p>
  
<p align="center"> The Java OOP course teaches you the principles of object-oriented programming(OOP), working with classes and objects, object-oriented modeling, and how to build hierarchies of classes. The basic principles of OOP such as abstraction(interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism are studied, as well as the most commonly used design patterns. Attention is paid to component testing(writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development(TDD), the use of reflection. <p>
